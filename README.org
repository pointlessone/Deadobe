photo retouching, image composition and image authoring. Essentially
it's the closest thing to Photoshop you can get for free. | | Krita |
Krita is a professional Free and open source (FOSS) painting program. It
is made by artists that want to see affordable art tools for everyone
withith concept art, texture and matte painters, illustrations and
comics.| #### Illustrator | Name | Description | | --- | --- | |
Inkscape | Unlike Illustrator, Inkscape is completely free and open
source, and it uses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) as its native format.
This lightweight app is usually recommended if you don't have a powerful
computer, as it also has many of the useful features from illustrator,
including layers, grouping objects, drawing, shape, calligraphy, pencil
tools, path simplification with variable threshold, bitmaps, and boolean
operations. Plus, you can open or import a wide range of file formats
including SVG, PDF, EPS, CDR, or even AI (Adobe Illustrator). | MyPaint
| The biggest difference with Illustrator is that MyPaint works with
bitmaps instead of vector graphics. It's open source software designed
mainly to illustrate and draw with a digitizer tablet. It has a simple
interface, where almost all the basic drawing functions are assigned to
keyboard shortcuts, which improves workflow speed. In addition, you can
hide the entire graphical interface and focus all attention on the
drawing without being distracted by unnecessary or complex buttons or
palettes. It's a good option if you are interested in digital
illustration without too many overwhelming features. | #### Indesign
